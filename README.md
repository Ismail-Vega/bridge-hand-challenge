# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Deck of Cards API

The API used to render all cards is https://deckofcardsapi.com/. Two endpoints where used:
  - Shuffle the Cards: https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/shuffle generate a new set of 52 cards.
  - Draw a Card: https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/<<deck_id>>/draw/?count=52 to get all cards.
  - A hook useDeckService was used to handle card generation and new game creation.
## This Project uses Redux Toolkit

### Points per Suit
- The application handles the number of points per suit that every player has.
- With this, we can calculate the total points per hand adding all suit values.

## Styles

### It was used a mixed styling system using sass and Material-UI components

The game board layout uses a grid system that allows the positioning of the hands in a better way.
